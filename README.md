# Backgammon with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

This project is part of the Monte Carlo course for the IASD Master's program at Université PSL, in collaboration with Simon Liétar. The objective is to implement a Backgammon game using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) techniques.

## Project Description

The Backgammon game implemented in this project features:
- A complete board representation using NumPy arrays.
- Player turns indicated clearly during the game execution.
- Legal moves validation based on standard Backgammon rules.
- Automated gameplay with random dice rolls and move selection.
- Preparation for future integration with MCTS algorithms to enhance decision-making.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd backgammon-mcts
```

3. Run the game script:
```bash
python backgammon_mcts.py
```

## Future Work

The next steps involve integrating a full Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize the gameplay strategy for both players, moving from random moves to informed decision-making.
